# Project-Skyrim-New-Weapon
Data analysis as a case study of the Coursera Data Analytics course. Based on the Skyrim weapons Database foundable on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/skyrim-weapons-dataset


This project follows the steps and good practices for data anylisis.

ASK :

1.What type of company does your client represent, and what are they asking you to accomplish?
My client is my company and his stakeholders as they ask me to analyze data that is part of its own game.

2.What are the key factors involved in the business task you are investigating?
They want to create brand new weapons but don't want to create a type of weapon that is over repesented. The data will hence be based on what types of weapons are under/over represented in the game.

3.What type of data will be appropriate for your analysis?
The Skyrim Weapons Dataset

4.Where will you obtain that data?
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmartini/skyrim-weapons-dataset

5.Who is your audience, and what materials will help you present to them effectively?
The audience will be the game developers such as those responsible for the design of the weapons.
Probably a manager also responsible in the game balancing that will make the final decision for what weapon or not.



PREPARE :

- The data is located and available on kaggle.com (See the sources).
- The data is structured, some values are missing.
- The data is Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited.
- The analysis is open source and reproductible as the process is published.
- Data integrity is checked by performing Data Validation, Data Consistency checks (Cross-table, cross-system), Data Anomaly Detection (Duplicates/ Outlier Detection).
- Having a reliable dataset is key to perform the data analysis and reach our goal.
- No problem was detected so far.

It is the fifth main installment in the Elder Scrolls series, following 2006's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011.
This dataset contains data for almost 300 weapons that can be used by the player in Skyrim.
The prices in gold are considered for the weapon without any modification (forge, alchemy, ...)



ANALYZE :
The analysis steps are processed in the file : Skyrim_Weapons_DA_01112023_V0.ipynb
This jupyter Notebook reveals all the cleaning, manipulations, analysis, vizualisation steps performed.
It will be tranferred to a kaggle notebook code to fill my portfolio.
